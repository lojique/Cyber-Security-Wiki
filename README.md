## About Me

My name is Adam

I currently work as a Penetration Tester. My current interest seem to gravitate towards Web App Pentesting and Exploit Development.

Outside of work I enjoy playing ice hockey, video games and learning languages. I speak English and Russian and I'm currently learning Italian. I also understand some of the Scandinavian languages.

I plan on using this book to document and store information that I deem worth saving and share it with others so that others can learn too

It should be noted that a lot of **information is copy/pasted from other resources and that content belongs to the original writers/rightful owners**. I will try to keep that consistent where needed

Still a very much work in progress, transferring old notes, writing new ones and organizing everything to my liking
