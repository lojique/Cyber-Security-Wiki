Assembly languages mainly work with the CPU and memory

### Memory

* A computer's memory is where the `temporary` data and instructions of currently running programs are located
* Also known as Primary Memory
* It is the primary location the CPU uses to retrieve and process data

Two main types of memory

#### Cache

* usually located within the CPU itself and hence is extremely fast compared to RAM

#### RAM

* much larger than cache memory, coming in sizes ranging from gigabytes up to terabytes
* located far away from the CPU cores
* much slower than cache memory
* Accessing data from RAM addresses takes many more instructions
* When a program is run, all of its data and instructions are moved from the storage unit to the RAM to be accessed when needed by the CPU
  * accessing them from the storage unit is much slower and will increase data processing times.
* Split into 4 main segments

| Segment | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Stack` | Has a Last-in First-out (LIFO) design and is fixed in size. Data in it can only be accessed in a specific order by push-ing and pop-ing data.                                                    |
| `Heap`  | Has a hierarchical design and is therefore much larger and more versatile in storing data, as data can be stored and retrieved in any order. However, this makes the heap slower than the Stack. |
| `Data`  | Has two parts: `Data`, which is used to hold variables, and `.bss`, which is used to hold unassigned variables (i.e., buffer memory for later allocation).                                       |
| `Text`  | Main assembly instructions are loaded into this segment to be fetched and executed by the CPU.                                                                                                   |

each application is allocated its Virtual Memory when it is run.&#x20;

This means that each application would have its own `stack`, `heap`, `data`, and `text` segments.



### IO/Storage

Example: the keyboard, the screen, or the long-term storage unit, also known as Secondary Memory.

* The processor can access and control IO devices using `Bus Interfaces`, which act as 'highways' to transfer data and addresses, using electrical charges for binary data
  * Each Bus has a capacity of bits (or electrical charges) it can carry simultaneously usually a multiple of 4-bits, ranging up to 128-bits.
  * usually used to access memory and other components outside the CPU itself.
* the storage unit stores permanent data, like the operating system files or entire applications and their data
  * The storage unit is the slowest to access
    * farthest away from CPU and slower in their design to allow more data storage

### Speed



| Component   | Speed                             | Size                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `Registers` | Fastest                           | Bytes               |
| `L1 Cache`  | Fastest, other than Registers     | Kilobytes           |
| `L2 Cache`  | Very fast                         | Megabytes           |
| `L3 Cache`  | Fast, but slower than the above   | Megabytes           |
| `RAM`       | Much slower than all of the above | Gigabytes-Terabytes |
| `Storage`   | Slowest                           | Terabytes and more  |

This is all relative to CPU clock speed
