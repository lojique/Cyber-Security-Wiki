  In this lab, you will learn to find and exploit vulnerable applications and
  services primarily using the Metasploit Framework and use other popular
  scanning utilities like dirb along the way.

# Black-box Penetration Test 3

This exercise will help you understand how to fingerprint an application and identify its vulnerabilities. You would also perform enumeration attacks to find weaknesses in the provided applications and perform privilege escalation.

## Lab Environment

In this lab environment, the user is going to get access to a Kali GUI instance. Three machines can be accessed using the tools installed on Kali on [server1.ine.local](http://server1.ine.local), [server2.ine.local](http://server2.ine.local) and [server3.ine.local](http://server3.ine.local).

**Objective:** Attack all machines to retrieve the flags!

## Tools

The best tools for this lab are:

* cURL
* dirb
* Nmap
* Metasploit Framework
* A Web Browser
