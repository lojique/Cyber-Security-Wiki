# Vulnerability Assessment

* Sometimes a client just asks for a vulnerability assessment instead of a full pentest
* A VA is a scan of the vulnerabilities found on networks and applications
  * This is faster and has a lighter load on the infrastructure
* As opposed to a pentest, you do not proceed to the exploitation phase
  * This implies you will not be able to confirm the vulnerabilities by testing them and giving proof of their existence&#x20;
* Vulnerability Scanners use a databse of known vulnerabiltiies and security audits to detect the vulnerabilities of a system.
  * They perform their probes on:
    * Daemons listening on TCP and UDP ports
    * Configuration files of operating systems, software suites, network devices, etc.
    * Windows registry entries
  * The purpose is to find vulnerabilties and misconfigurations
* Some scanners are OpenVAS, Nexpose and GFI LAN Guard; one of the most popular is Nessus
