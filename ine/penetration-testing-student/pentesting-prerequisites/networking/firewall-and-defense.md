# Firewall & Defense

## Packet Filtering Firewalls

* The most basic feature of a firewall is <mark style="color:red;">**packet filtering**</mark>
  * An admin can create rules which will filter packets according to certain characteristics like:
    1. Source IP/Destination IP
    2. Source/Destination Port
    3. Protocol
* Packet filters inspect the header of every packet to choose how to treat the packet. The more common actions are:
  * <mark style="color:red;">**Allow**</mark>: allow the packet to pass
  * <mark style="color:red;">**Drop**</mark>: drops the packet without any diagnostic message to the packet source host
  * <mark style="color:red;">**Deny**</mark>: do not let the packet pass, but notify the source host
