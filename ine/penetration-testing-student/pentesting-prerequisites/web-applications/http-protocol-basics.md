# HTTP Protocol Basics

## HTTP Requests

![HTTP request example](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (584).png>)

* **HTTP verb**, or request method, states the type of the request (ex: PUT, TRACE, HEAD, POST)
  * next you have the <mark style="color:red;">path</mark> (/) and the <mark style="color:red;">protocol version</mark> (HTTP 1.1)
* **Host** specifies the Internet hostname and port number of the resource being requested
* **User-Agent** tells the server what client software is issuing the request (i.e. firefox, Chrome, mobile app)
  * Also reveals to the server the OS version
* **Accept** gets sent by the browser to specify which document type it expects in the response
* **Accept-Language** is for the browser asking for a specific (human) language in the response
* **Accept-Encoding** restricts the content encoding, not the content itself
  * In the example above, the browser would accept gzip and deflate types of compression
* **Connection** allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection
  * In the example above, future communications with the server will reuse the current connection

## HTTP Responses

When the server receives a request, it processes it and then sends an HTTP response to the client

![HTTP response example](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (100).png>)

* The first line (**Status-Line**) has the **protocol version** followed by a numeric **status code** (200) and its relative **textual meaning** (OK)
  * Common status codes:

* **Date** represents the date and time at which the message was originated
* **Cache-Control**: the server informs the client about cached content
* **Content-Type** lets the client known how to interpret the body of the message
* **Content-Encoding** extends Content-Type. In the example above, the message body is compressed with gzip
* **Server** contains the header of the server that generated the content
  * Although an optional field, this can be very useful during a pentest
* **Content-Length** indicates the length, in bytes, of the message body

## HTTPS

* Protects data exchanged between the client and the server
* Does not protect against web application flaws
  * Still prone to XSS and SQLi
