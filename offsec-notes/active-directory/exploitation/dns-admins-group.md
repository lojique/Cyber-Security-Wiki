# DNS Admins Group

The technique abuses the privileges given by default to the members of the DNS Admins group.

The attack vector consists of injecting a malicious DLL into the DNS process running as a System to escalate when the service restarts.

For the attack to work, you should have _compromised an account that is a member of the DNS Admins group or has the write privileges to a DNS server object_.
