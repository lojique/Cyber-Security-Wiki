# OSINT

`Open-Source Intelligence` (`OSINT`) is a process for finding publicly available information on a target company and/or individuals that allows identification of events (i.e., public and private meetings), external and internal dependencies, and connections. OSINT uses public (`Open-Source`) information from freely available sources to obtain the desired results. Some sources for collecting data are, for example, mass media such as television, radio, print media, or the Internet. The information collected from these sources will be analyzed, evaluated, and linked to each other to gain the necessary insights about our target.

The focus of OSINT lies in the word "`Intelligence`," which means constructing relationships between individual pieces of information from which we can create specific patterns and profiles about the target. The art here is to look `behind the scenes` and `think outside the box`.

In `OSINT`, information is categorized and linked together to form a logical connection.
