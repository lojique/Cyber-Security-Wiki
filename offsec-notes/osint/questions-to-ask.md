# Questions to ask

### Company Information

Company information includes the company's general overview. This means we will try to understand the company's structure:

* How many employees does the company have?
* What is its objective?
* How is the company positioned in society and the market?
* How profitable is the company?
* How does the company function?
* How do they manage their tasks?
* What services does the company provide?
* How is the company positioned financially?
* Which target group does the company pursue?
* Where is the company located?
* What are the physical security measures?
* How do interaction and advertising with (potential) customers take place?
* How strong is the company's reputation?

The process of staff investigation, such as employees, supervisors, and team leaders, can provide us with valuable information that allows us to assess their knowledge and experience. It is a very time-consuming stage to search for these people, as we first have to find all the people employed by the target company and then try to find everything relevant about them if the signed contract allows it.

In this search, we try to determine:

* What position do the employees hold?
* Which departments exist within the company?
* Their day-to-day tasks.
* What are they responsible for?
* What dependencies do the employee have?

Social networks are used for personal profiles and the sharing of information from one's own private life. They are also used to publish products and news that provide new information about the company and its technologies. Therefore, in this phase, we try to determine:

* Which products are being developed?
* Which technologies are utilized?
* Who are the developers?
* Which conferences do the employees attend?
* Where are these products used?
* Who uses these products and services?

### Infrastructure

For the infrastructure domain, we move into more technical details. Here we try to find out:

* How is the company set up in terms of information technology?
* Who are the administrators?
* Does it meet the best possible security standards?
* Which technologies are used?
* What entries are there about the domain?
* Which certificates can be obtained?
* How many domains are registered to the company?
* What is the ASN?
* Which netblocks has the company reserved?
* Which third-party providers are used, and for what?
* How many and which servers are publicly accessible?
* How many and which email addresses are available?
