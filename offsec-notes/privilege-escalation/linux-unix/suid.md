SUID/Setuid stands for "set user ID upon execution", it is enabled by default in every Linux distributions. If a file with this bit is ran, the uid will be changed by the owner one. If the file owner is `root`, the uid will be changed to `root` even if it was executed from user `bob`. SUID bit is represented by an `s`.
