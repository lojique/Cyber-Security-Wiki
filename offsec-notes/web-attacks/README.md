| 8.     | [Insecure Deserialization](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A8\_2017-Insecure\_Deserialization)                                          | This flaw often leads to remote code execution, injection attacks, or privilege escalation attacks.                                                                                                                                                            |
