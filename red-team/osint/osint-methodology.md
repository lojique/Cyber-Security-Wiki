## Workflow

To make this structured methodology efficient, we need to work with two browser windows.

**`1. Research Browser`**

We use this one only for our research. Here we send all search requests and log the entire OSINT process. The research browser's history must be cleaned before use to prevent us from logging results from other companies. We can use the add-on called [History Master](https://github.com/jiacai2050/history-master) to log our searches and finally export them as documentation.

**`2. Resource Browser`**

The resource browser serves as a summary of the information resources we find during the investigation. In this one, we move all the information resources to which we can return to search for information for other categories. For example, we will get to know development platforms containing leaks and names of employees or developers, email addresses, and usernames.

In this part, we can also use the add-on called [SingleFile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/?utm\_source=addons.mozilla.org\&utm\_medium=referral\&utm\_content=search). This allows us to copy the web pages with the information and save them locally as proof.

The actual process is quite simple, as we now split our results between `two` browsers. So as soon as we have found a new information resource and examined it in the `Research Browser` and discover that there is more useful information there, we drag the newly opened tab to the `Resource Browser`, which we will turn to later.

`We document all our discoveries and structure them accordingly to each phase and our cycle.`

If we find valuable information on an information resource that we want to document, we should download this web page accordingly with `SingleFile` and save it.



## Logging

To work efficiently and in a structured way, we must also document the results and information we find clearly. However, we also need to log our steps and prove how we found the information. With the two different browsers, we have found a way to separate our search from the resources. To create clear documentation, we need three components:

1. Visited websites
2. Timestamp
3. Queries
